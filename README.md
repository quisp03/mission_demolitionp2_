# Mission Demolition P2
# By Marquis Pritchett
Mission Demolition is physics-based demolition game where the players use a slingshot to launch projectiles at a castle to reach their goal. The aim is to score inside the protected zone to move onto the next level. A points system has been added and deducts based on the amount of shots player takes to pass onto the next stage.
